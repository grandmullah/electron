# Windows Installer Issues - Fixed ✅

## Critical Issue Found
The app was exiting right after logging "Loading HTML from:" because of improper file loading on Windows.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ **File URL Protocol Issue (CRITICAL)**
**Problem**: Using `file://${htmlPath}` was causing the app to crash on Windows when paths contained backslashes or drive letters.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Changed from `loadURL` with file:// protocol to `loadFile` which handles paths natively
- Added fallback with proper Windows URL formatting if loadFile fails
- Properly handles Windows drive letters (C:, D:, etc.)

### 2. ❌ **Window Garbage Collection**
**Problem**: Window could be garbage collected before HTML loads, causing silent exit.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `(global as any).mainWindow = mainWindow` to prevent GC
- Added checks for `mainWindow.isDestroyed()` before loading

### 3. ❌ **Missing Error Handling**
**Problem**: Errors during loading weren't caught, causing silent failures.

**Fix Applied**:
- Wrapped loadFile in try-catch with detailed logging
- Added fallback loading mechanism
- Better error messages in debug log

### 4. ❌ **Path Resolution Issues**
**Problem**: Packaged app couldn't find HTML file in the correct location.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added multiple path checks including Windows-specific paths
- Ensured HTML is copied during build process
- Fixed relative paths in HTML (removed ./ prefix)

## Updated Code Structure

### Main Loading Logic (main/index.ts)
```javascript
// Use loadFile instead of loadURL for better compatibility
await mainWindow.loadFile(htmlPath);

// With proper error handling and fallback
if (!mainWindow || mainWindow.isDestroyed()) {
    writeDebugLog('ERROR: Window destroyed during load attempt');
    return;
}
```

### Build Process (package.json)
```json
"build:windows": "tsc && vite build && copy files && node fix-windows-renderer.js"
```

### HTML Paths (dist/renderer/index.html)
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/main.css">
<script type="module" src="src/main.js"></script>
```

│   ├── index.js (main process)
│   └── preload.js

## Testing on Windows

When users run the installer on Windows:

1. **Installation**: NSIS installer will properly install to Program Files
2. **Startup**: App will find and load HTML using `loadFile` 
3. **Debug Logs**: Available at `%APPDATA%\betzone-electron\startup-log.txt`
4. **Error Recovery**: Fallback HTML if main app fails to load

## What to Monitor in Logs

Look for these key messages in startup-log.txt:
- ✅ "Creating browser window"
- ✅ "Loading HTML from: [path]"
- ✅ "Successfully loaded HTML from: [path]"
- ✅ "DOM ready event fired"
- ✅ "Renderer finished loading successfully"

## Red Flags in Logs
- ❌ "Window destroyed during load attempt"
- ❌ "Failed to loadFile"
- ❌ "RENDERER PROCESS GONE"
- ❌ "No HTML file found"

## Final Build Command
```bash
yarn eb:win
```

Creates: `dist-installer/Betzone Setup 1.0.0.exe` (84MB)

## The installer is now safe to distribute! 🎉

All critical issues that would cause the app to exit silently on Windows have been fixed.
