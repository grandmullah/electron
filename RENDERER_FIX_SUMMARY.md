# BetZone Electron Renderer Fix Summary

## Problem
The renderer process and DOM were not getting ready when the app was shared on Windows. The app would quit unexpectedly without showing proper error messages or logs.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing Preload Script Path**: The `webPreferences` in the BrowserWindow configuration was missing the preload script path.

2. **File Path Issues**: Windows has different path handling than macOS/Linux. The app was failing to find the correct HTML file path in packaged Windows builds.

3. **Module Loading Issues**: The HTML file was using paths that didn't work correctly when loaded via `file://` protocol on Windows.

4. **Async Loading**: The window creation wasn't properly handling async operations, causing race conditions.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Preload Script Path
```javascript
webPreferences: {
    preload: path.join(__dirname, 'preload.js')
}
```

### 2. Improved Path Resolution
- Added Windows-specific path checks
- Used `file://` protocol for better compatibility
- Added current working directory paths for packaged apps
- Made paths relative with `./` prefix in HTML

### 3. Better Error Handling
- Made `createWindow` async to properly handle loading
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Added fallback HTML when renderer fails
- DevTools only open in development mode

### 4. Fixed HTML Paths
Changed from:
```html
<script type="module" src="src/main.js"></script>
```
To:
```html
<script type="module" src="./src/main.js"></script>
```

### 5. Created Windows-Specific Build Process
- Added `build:win` script that fixes paths after building
- Created `fix-windows-renderer.js` to ensure Windows compatibility
- Created `build-windows-safe.bat` for easy Windows building

## How to Build for Windows

### Option 1: Quick Build (from Windows)
```batch
build-windows-safe.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual Build
```bash
# On Windows
yarn build:win
yarn eb:win

# On Mac/Linux (cross-compile)
yarn build
yarn eb:win
```

## Testing

The app now:
- ✅ Shows proper debug logs during startup
- ✅ Loads the renderer process correctly
- ✅ Handles path differences between platforms
- ✅ Shows fallback UI if renderer fails
- ✅ Logs all events to `%APPDATA%/betzone-electron/startup-log.txt`

## Debug Log Location

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\betzone-electron\startup-log.txt`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/betzone-electron/startup-log.txt`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/betzone-electron/startup-log.txt`

## What to Check if Issues Persist

1. Check the startup log for any "Failed to load" messages
2. Look for "RENDERER PROCESS GONE" in the logs
3. Ensure antivirus isn't blocking the app
4. Try running as Administrator
5. Check that Visual C++ Redistributables are installed

## Key Changes in main/index.ts

1. Line 84: Added preload script path
2. Line 66: Made createWindow async
3. Lines 207-261: Improved path resolution logic
4. Lines 235-242: Added development server support
5. Line 322: DevTools only in dev mode

The app should now work correctly when packaged and distributed on Windows!
